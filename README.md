# PoreOver: Nanopore basecalling in TensorFlow
## Introduction
PoreOver is a basecalling tool for the Oxford Nanopore sequencing platform and is under active development.
It can serve as a standalone neural network basecaller or decode the output probabilities of CTC-style models from other basecallers (i.e. [Flappie](https://github.com/nanoporetech/flappie) and Guppy).
It is intended as a platform on which to explore new algorithms and architectures for basecalling and decoding.
The current version implements a bidirectional RNN with LSTM cells and CTC loss to call bases from raw signal, an architecture inspired by other community basecallers such as DeepNano (Bo≈æa et al. 2017) and Chiron (Teng et al. 2018).

### Requirements
* Python 3
* TensorFlow (GPU installation recommended)

## Usage examples

`git clone https://github.com/jordisr/poreover`

`python poreover --help`

### Training a basecalling model

We can run a few iterations of gradient descent to train a model on a small dataset.

`python poreover train --data poreover/examples/training/toy --training_steps 100`

Once there is a model to load, we can make a basecall on a sample read (of course, after only a little training on a toy dataset we would not expect it to be very accurate).

`python poreover call --fast5 poreover/examples/read.fast5 --model run-0 --out test.fasta`

### Basecalling a read with a trained model

We can compare this to the output of a model that has seen more training on a larger dataset. In the `models/` directory there are models for pore versions R9 (trained on E.coli) and R9.5 (trained on human).

`python poreover call --fast5 poreover/examples/read.fast5 --model poreover/models/r9.5 --out read.fasta`

### Decoding a flip-flop trace

The newer versions of the ONT basecallers implement a CTC-style "flip-flop" model for basecalling and can optionally output the probabilities of each nucleotide. This is done either with `--fast5-out` in Guppy or the `--trace` option in [Flappie](https://github.com/nanoporetech/flappie).

PoreOver can read and decode these probabilities, yielding a basecalled sequence.

`python poreover decode poreover/examples/flappie_trace.hdf5`

`python poreover decode poreover/examples/guppy_flipflop.fast5`

### Pair decoding of 1D^2 reads

Pair decoding of probability profiles (as described [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-91938-6_11)) is under development with the goal of higher accuracy 1D^2 sequencing.
