# PoreOver: Nanopore basecalling in TensorFlow
### Introduction
PoreOver is a neural network basecaller for the Oxford Nanopore sequencing platform and is under active development. It is intended as a platform on which to explore new algorithms and architectures for basecalling. The current version uses a bidirectional RNN with LSTM cells and CTC loss to call bases from raw signal, and has been inspired by other community basecallers such as DeepNano (Bo≈æa et al. 2017) and Chiron (Teng et al. 2018).

#### Consensus basecalling
Consensus basecalling, intended for higher accuracy 1D^2 sequencing, is currently being added to PoreOver, though these algorithms are still being tested and not yet ready for production use.

### Requirements
* TensorFlow (GPU installation recommended)
* Python 3

### Usage examples
Full options for `train_model.py` and `run_model.py` available with the `--help` flag.

First, we need to extract the toy training data set in `data/`
```
cd data
tar -xzf train.tar.gz
```

We can now train the model for a few iterations.

`python train_model.py --data data/train --training_steps 100`

Once there is a model to load, we can make a basecall on a sample read (of course,
    after only a little training on a toy dataset we would not expect it to be very accurate). 

`python run_model.py --fast5 data/read.fast5 --model run-0 --fasta`
 
We can compare this to the output of a model that has seen more training on a larger dataset. In the `models/` directory there are models for pore versions R9 (trained on E.coli) and R9.5 (trained on human).

`python run_model.py --fast5 data/read.fast5 --model models/r9 --fasta`
